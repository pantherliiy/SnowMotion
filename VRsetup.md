# VR Setup for Unity 2020.2.7f1

Used tutorial written at "https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/kno23d/unity_202021f1_setting_up_unity_with_the_oculus/". Shows how to add control for Oculus Quest 2. Note that Unity version 2020 apparently uses different methods for integrating the oculus quest into Unity. For example the XR plugin is used for 2019.x.x versions. In case of errors, it may be nessecary to remove the oculus files.
